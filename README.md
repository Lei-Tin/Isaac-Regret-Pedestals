# New Regret Pedestals

A forked and modified version from https://github.com/seanstertm/Isaac-Regret-Pedestals. Added the feature to see the original item if it was rerolled via D6 or restock machine.

This mod leaves a fading after-image of items that you did not pick up that disappear. This primarly comes in to play with alt floors, options items, voiding, and angel deals.
